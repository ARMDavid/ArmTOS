# ArmTOS
This project is an attempt to create an Atari TOS ABI compatible Operating System for the ARM based Raspberry Pi SBC's, from the ground up.

Everything I provide here will be under a MIT license, things that are ported from others may be under other licenses, as that is up to the original author.   I beleive in true Open Source and will not use the GPL for anyting I create.

I am beggining by using Ultibo as a bios to speed up development and not to have to worry about most of the Hardware specific stuff, especialy the USB stuff.

For the first few versions I will be using a borrowed AES and VDI (the FreeTOS AES, and oVDISIS) ported to the ARM v6/7/8 CPU's.   These are both open source, both under the GPLv2.    I intend to replace these as time goes.

This is likely to be a slow moving project, as it is a big one.
