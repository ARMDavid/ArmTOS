# ArmTOS
This project is an attempt to create an Atari TOS ABI compatible Operating System for the ARM based Raspberry Pi SBC's, from the ground up.

I am beggining by using Ultibo as a bios to speed up development and not to have to worry about most of the Hardware specific stuff, especialy the USB stuff.

For the first few versions I will be using a borrowed AES and VDI (the FreeTOS AES, and oVDISIS) ported to the ARM v6/7/8 CPU's.   These are both open source, both under the GPLv2.    I intend to replace these as time goes.

This is likely to be a slow moving project, as it is a big one.
